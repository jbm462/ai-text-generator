# AI Text Generator

## Project Overview
A project to build an AI text generator from scratch, learning core concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and pattern recognition.

## Features
- Multiple generation modes:
  - Basic word chain generation
  - Structured sentence generation
  - Context-aware text generation (3-word patterns)
- Command line interface
- Configurable word count
- Pattern learning and recognition

## Usage

Basic word chain generation:
python3 bigram_ai.py --mode basic --words 20

Structured sentence generation:
python3 bigram_ai.py --mode structured --words 30

Context-aware generation:
python3 bigram_ai.py --mode context --words 40

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- argparse for CLI
- Text processing techniques
- Probability-based generation

## Learning Concepts
- Text processing and tokenization
- N-gram models and pattern recognition
- Probability-based text generation
- Command line argument parsing
- Software development best practices

## Learning Journey
This project demonstrates understanding of:
- Text pattern recognition
- Probability and statistics
- Python programming
- Text generation algorithms
- Code organization and documentation
